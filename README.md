Horiseon (Link to webpage: file:///Users/Adam/Projects/urban-octo-telegram-master/Develop/index.html )

In this project, I helped optimize the Horiseon webpage by adding missing accessibilty links as well as cleaning up the style sheet by combining class elements.

Technology

This project was created with HTML and CSS all written through Visual Studio Code.

Github

I pushed this project to a github repository which can be found at the following link: https://github.com/adambedingfield/code-refactor-challenge.git

Challenges

There were two challenges I faced when refactoring the code, the main one was determining which parts of the code weren't needed for the website to appear as asked. The other issue was realizing the images on the right side needed alt attributes.Inititially I thought they didnt but they are not listed as SVG images therefore accessibility voiceovers were depicting a "missing image description".
